- Initialized the WordPress theme project.
- Set up basic theme files: `index.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `style.css`, `functions.php`.
- Corrected theme installation issues by moving `style.css` to the root and enqueueing it properly in `functions.php`.
- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub.
- Created documentation structure.
